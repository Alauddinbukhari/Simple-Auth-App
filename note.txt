Main Application Flow

Frontend (React)

A simple homepage with two options: Login and Signup.

Clicking either option navigates the user to the respective page:

/login → Login form (email + password)

/signup → Signup form (name, email, password)

After a successful login or signup, the JWT token received from the backend is stored in localStorage or sessionStorage.

On subsequent requests (like accessing a protected dashboard), the JWT token is sent in the Authorization header.

Backend (Express + MongoDB + JWT)

Signup Endpoint (/api/signup):

Receives user details.

Checks if the user already exists.

Hashes the password.

Creates a new user in MongoDB.

Generates a JWT token containing user info (like ID/email).

Sends the token back in the response.

Login Endpoint (/api/login):

Receives email and password.

Finds the user and verifies the hashed password.

If valid, generates a new JWT token.

Sends token in response.

Protected Routes:

Use an authentication middleware that:

Reads JWT from the Authorization header.

Verifies it with your secret key.

If valid → allows access.

If invalid or missing → returns 401 Unauthorized.

Client-Server Communication

Frontend stores token → adds it to every request header:

Authorization: Bearer <token>


Backend verifies token before processing protected requests.
